# Robot Gladiators

## Description
Simple game application, in JavaScript, where you face off with 3 robot gladiators, in separate rounds.  You each start with health, attack, & money points.  You choose whether or not to fight or skip.  Skip will end the round, but not the game.  At the end of a round, you will have an option to shop and spend money on health or attack points.  You may leave the shop if you wish.  Who starts the attack, for each round, is randomized, as are the attack points. You may complete up to 3 rounds, facing each robot opponent, during the game.  The highest score that has been reached, to date, will be saved in local storage.  The player may choose to start another game or quit, at the end of the game.
